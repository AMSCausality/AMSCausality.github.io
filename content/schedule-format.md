# Workshop Schedule

TBD

## Format

The workshop will be **in-person** at NeurIPS 2023 and, as such, registration for NeurIPS (workshops) is required to attend. 

Videos of the talks and spotlight papers will be collected and posted to the website in advance of the workshop.


<!-- ## Poster Session

All accepted papers will be presented as a poster at the workshop. All posters should be put up in the morning (e.g., during the first break) and will remain up during the whole day (i.e., all posters are presented during both poster sessions). -->

[We](/organizers) are starting a new Causality seminar in Amsterdam, that would bring together researchers working in causality across Amsterdam institutions (VU, UvA, Amsterdam UMC and CWI) and across multiple fields and disciplines. 

We plan to organize 4 events per year, where each event consist of two scientific talks and a networking events with some drinks afterwards.

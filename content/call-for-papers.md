# Call for Papers

We welcome submissions related to any aspects of CRL, including but not limited to:

* Causal representation learning, including self-supervised, multi-modal or multi-environment CRL, either in time series or in an atemporal setting, observational or interventional
* Causality-inspired representation learning, including learning representations that are only _approximately_ causal, but still useful in terms of generalization or transfer learning
* Abstractions of causal models or in general multi-level causal systems
* Connecting CRL with system identification, learning differential equations from data or sequences of images, or in general connections to dynamical systems
* Theoretical works on identifiability in representation learning broadly
* Real-world applications of CRL, e.g. in biology, healthcare, (medical) imaging or robotics; including new benchmarks or datasets, or addressing the gap from theory to practice


<!-- * Learning latent (structural) causal models & structured (deep) generative models
* Interventional representations, causal digital twins & structured (causal) world models
* Post-hoc extraction of causal relations from (deep) generative models
* Self-supervised causal representation learning
* Multi-environment & multi-view causal representation learning
* Micro vs. macro/coarse-grained/multi-level causal systems
* Identifiable representation learning & nonlinear ICA
* Uncertainty quantification in (causal) representation learning
* Group-theoretic & symmetry-based views on disentanglement
* Invariance & equivariance in representation learning
* Interdisciplinary perspectives on causal representation learning, including from cognitive science, psychology, (computational) neuroscience or philosophy
* Real-world applications of causal representation learning, including in biology, medical sciences, or robotics -->


Submissions should present novel, unpublished work. Work that previously appeared in non-archival venues (such as arXiv or other workshops without proceedings) is allowed.

The CRL workshop is non-archival, and should thus generally not violate dual submission policies at other archival venues; if unsure, please check yourself with the corresponding venue.

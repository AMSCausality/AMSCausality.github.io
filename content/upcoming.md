        Predictions under hypothetical interventions are estimates of what a person's risk of an outcome would be if they were to follow a particular treatment strategy, given their individual characteristics. Such predictions can give important input to medical decision making. However, evaluating predictive performance of interventional predictions is challenging. Standard ways of evaluating predictive performance do not apply when using observational data, because prediction under interventions involves obtaining predictions of the outcome under conditions that are different to those that are observed for a subset of individuals in the validation dataset. This work describes methods for evaluating counterfactual predictive performance of predictions under interventions for time-to-event outcomes. This means we aim to assess how well predictions would match the validation data if all individuals had followed the treatment strategy under which predictions are made. We focus on counterfactual performance evaluation using longitudinal observational data, and under treatment strategies that involve sustaining a particular treatment regime over time. We introduce an estimation approach using artificial censoring and inverse probability weighting which involves creating a validation dataset that mimics the treatment strategy under which predictions are made. We extend measures of calibration, discrimination (c-index and cumulative/dynamic AUC) and overall prediction error (Brier score) to allow assessment of counterfactual performance. The methods are evaluated using a simulation study, including scenarios in which the methods should detect poor performance. Applying our methods in the context of liver transplantation shows that our procedure allows quantification of the performance of predictions supporting crucial decisions on organ allocation.

        As more and more decisions that have a significant ethical dimension are being outsourced to AI systems, it is important to have a definition of moral responsibility that can be applied to AI systems. Moral responsibility for an outcome of an agent who performs some action is commonly taken to involve both a causal condition and an epistemic condition: the action should cause the outcome, and the agent should have been aware – in some form or other – of the possible moral consequences of their action. This paper presents a formal definition of both conditions within the framework of causal models. I compare my approach to the existing approaches of Braham and van Hees (BvH) and of Halpern and Kleiman-Weiner (HK). I then generalize our definition into a degree of responsibility.

        <td> <a href="https://johannes-textor.name/"> Johannes Textor (RU, RUMC) </a> - Are DAGs Really Useful for Causal Reasoning in Complex Systems? <br><br>
        Much causal inference methodology is based on the assumption that the world can be neatly and meaningfully described by DAGs or similar formalisms. I will explore the use of simulation to investigate when and how this assumption breaks down when facing complex systems with emergent properties. Specifically, I will discuss a simple biophysical simulation model of a cell for which we have both complete knowledge of the computation graph and a good understanding of its emergent properties and phenomenology. Using this system as an example, I will illustrate the conceptual and ontological problems that arise when attempting to formulate causal processes in terms of graphical models whose nodes represent high-level descriptions of emergent phenomena. I argue that these problems are similar to those resulting from the use of social categories as nodes in DAGs, and that they cannot be easily addressed by existing extensions of the DAG framework.

<td> <a href ="https://www.amsterdamumc.org/en/research/researchers/julia-kowalska.htm"> Julia Kowalska (Amsterdam UMC)</a> - Regression Discontinuity Design from Bayesian perspective: opportunities and challenges <br><br>
    Regression discontinuity design (RDD) is a quasi-experimental design that aims at the causal effect estimation of an intervention that is assigned based on a cutoff criterion. Regression discontinuity design exploits the idea that close to the cutoff units below and above the cutoff are similar hence can be meaningfully compared. However, the causal effect can be estimated only locally at the cutoff point. In many experiments, the cutoff criterion serves only as a guideline rather than a strict rule. Nonetheless, the guidelines may not be publicly known, or the cutoff used in practice is shifted with respect to the official one. If the analysis is performed at a false cutoff point, it leads to meaningless results, but as the intervention assignment is binary, the location of the cutoff may be unclear. Through the Bayesian approach, we can incorporate prior knowledge and uncertainty about the cutoff location in the causal effect estimation. At the same time, RDD is a boundary point estimation problem, whereas the Bayesian model is fitted to the whole data. Therefore, a natural challenge arises: how to make Bayesian inference more local?

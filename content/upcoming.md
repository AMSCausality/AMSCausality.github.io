        <br>
        <br>
        A major challenge in estimating treatment effects in observational studies is the reliance on untestable conditions, such as the assumption of no unmeasured confounding. In this talk, we discuss a novel falsification strategy for testing the assumption of no unmeasured confounding in a setting with observational data from multiple heterogeneous sources, which we refer to as environments. Our proposed falsification strategy leverages the key observation that unmeasured confounding can create spurious correlations between causal mechanisms across environments. Building on this observation, we develop a procedure that detects these dependencies with high statistical power while controlling false positives. The algorithm does not require access to randomized data and, in contrast to other falsification approaches, functions even under transportability violations when the environment has a direct effect on the outcome of interest. To showcase the practical relevance of our approach, we demonstrate that our method efficiently detects confounding in both simulated and semi-synthetic real-world data.

# Past Meetings

As for all NeurIPS workshops, submissions should contain **original and previously unpublished research** and they should be formatted using the [NeurIPS latex style](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2023/PaperInformation/StyleFiles). Papers should be submitted as a PDF file and should be **maximum 6 pages** in length, including all main results, figures, and tables. Appendices containing additional details are allowed, but reviewers are not expected to take this into account. 

The workshop will not have proceedings (or in other words, it will not be archival), which means you can submit the same or extended work as a publication to other venues after the workshop. This means we also accept submissions to other venues, as long as they are not published before the workshop date in December.

<!-- ## Camera-Ready Revisions 

Camera-Ready revisions are now enabled in OpenReview. While the workshop has no official proceedings, we strongly encourage you to submit a revised "camera-ready" version taking reviewers' comments and suggestions into account. We suggest uploading a revised version prior to the workshop, and possibly another final version (incorporating additional feedback from the poster session and workshop) by the revision deadline of 12 August, one week after the workshop. 


## Updated Style-File
